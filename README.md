# EX.-NO-2-E-IMPLEMENTATION-OF-SHA-I

## AIM:
  To implement the SHA-I hashing technique using C program.
  
## ALGORITHM:

  STEP-1: Read the 256-bit key values.
  
  STEP-2: Divide into five equal-sized blocks named A, B, C, D and E.
  
  STEP-3: The blocks B, C and D are passed to the function F.
  
  STEP-4: The resultant value is permuted with block E.
  
  STEP-5: The block A is shifted right by ‘s’ times and permuted with the result of
  
  
  STEP-6: Then it is permuted with a weight value and then with some other key pair and taken as the first block.
  
  STEP-7: Block A is taken as the second block and the block B is shifted by ‘s’ times and taken as the third block.
  
  STEP-8: The blocks C and D are taken as the block D and E for the final output.

## PROGRAM:

## OUTPUT:

## RESULT:
  Thus the SHA-1 hashing technique had been implemented successfully.
